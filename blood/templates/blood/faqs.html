Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but can make a big difference in the lives of others. The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour. The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average. The steps in the process are:

Registration

You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number.

Health History

You will answer some questions about your health history.

Recipients

You will be shown all the awaiting recipient requests of your blood group around you.

</h4>
<div class="panel-body" style="border-top-color: #ebccd1;border-top: 1px solid #ddd;padding: 15px;">
Donating blood is a safe process. Each donor’s blood is collected through a new, sterile needle that is used once and then discarded. Although most people feel fine after donating blood, a small number of people may feel lightheaded or dizzy, have an upset stomach or experience a bruise or pain where the needle was inserted. Extremely rarely, loss of consciousness, nerve damage or artery damage occur.

</h4>
<div class="panel-body" style="border-top-color: #ebccd1;border-top: 1px solid #ddd;padding: 15px;">

You must wait at least eight weeks (56 days) between donations of whole blood and 16 weeks (112 days) between double red cell donations. Platelet apheresis donors may give every 7 days up to 24 times per year. Regulations are different for those giving blood for themselves (autologous donors).</div>

</h4>

After you give blood:

Take the following precautions:
– Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.
– Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.
– If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.
– Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.
– Eat healthy meals and consider adding iron-rich foods to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.
If you get a bruise:  Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.
If you get dizzy or lightheaded:  Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.
And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!
